# Confined-Space-Airbone-Disease-Transimission

Aimed to bring more insight in how Covid-19 spreads in confined space envrionment such as classroom envrionemnt. However, the modification of code can be easily expanded to further scope, such as dormitory, study areas, malls and etc. 

This project is designed for simulating confined space disease transimission. The induction of algorithm comes from the famous Wells-Riley Equation. There are a few 
improvements in this code to consider the influence of distance when considering infection. 

The project takes many other factors, such as ventilation rate, room size, distance, quanta(infective strength of individual virus).
